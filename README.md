AR-binding-site-analysis
========================

Code used for AR ChIP-seq meta-analysis

#pull BAMs from GEO/arrayexpress and call peaks uniformly (use GEOquery for tracability - keep all code in .rmd)
# --> diffbind analysis for quantitative analysis or overlaps/differences
# --> identify core sets, merge peak sets for these and use to annotate Gx tc.
